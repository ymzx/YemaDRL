## <img title="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48054808/157795569-9fc77c85-732f-4870-9be0-99a7fe2cff27.png" alt="" width="20"> Why was YemaDRL created?

<p align="justify">
  <strong>YemaDRL</strong> was developed to address the steep learning curve often faced by beginners in deep reinforcement learning. Many existing frameworks have complex codebases, unfriendly high-level APIs or inconsistent coding style, making them difficult for newcomers to grasp. YemaDRL simplifies this by offering a clean, modular design that facilitates easy experimentation and rapid prototyping. It serves as a foundation for understanding key RL concepts, allowing users to transition smoothly to more advanced frameworks, whether for single-agent learning frameworks like SpinningUp, Tianshou, Stable-Baselines3, or RLlib, or for multi-agent frameworks such as PettingZoo, PyMARL, MAlib, and MARLlib, making those tools more intuitive and effective for further exploration.

## ðŸ‘« Who is YemaDRL for? 
YemaDRL is designed for beginners in reinforcement learning, researchers, and developers who are interested in exploring or developing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solutions. It serves as a bridge for those transitioning from basic machine learning concepts to more advanced RL algorithms.
- Learning Stage: For those starting with DRL concepts, offering pre-built algorithms and environments.
- Prototyping Stage: When researchers and developers need a flexible platform to quickly test new ideas or modify existing algorithms.
- Research & Deployment Stage: For researchers applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems such as autonomous systems, robotics, or gaming.
